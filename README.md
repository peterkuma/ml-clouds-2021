This repository contains code for the paper "Cloud type machine learning shows
better present-day cloud representation in climate models is associated with
higher climate sensitivity".

If you have any questions about the code you can contact the authors or submit
an Issue on GitHub.

## Requirements

The code can be run on a Linux distribution with the following software:

- Python 3
- Cython

and Python packages:

- tensorflow
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pymc3
- pst
- aquarius-time
- ds-format
- pyproj
- pandas

On Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Devuan, ...), the required
software can be installed with:

```sh
apt install python3 cython3
```

We recommend installing the Python packages in a virtual environment (venv):

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

To install the Python packages:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
