This repository contains code for the paper "Cloud type machine learning shows
better present-day cloud representation in climate models is associated with
higher climate sensitivity".

If you have any questions about the code you can contact the authors or submit
an Issue on GitHub.

## Requirements

The code can be run on a Linux distribution with the following software:

- Python 3
- Cython
- aria2

and Python packages:

- tensorflow
- scipy
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pymc3
- pst-format
- aquarius-time
- ds-format
- pyproj
- pandas

On Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Devuan, ...), the required
software can be installed with:

```sh
apt install python3 cython3 aria2
```

We recommend installing the Python packages in a virtual environment (venv):

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

To install the Python packages:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input datasets

### Historical Unidata Internet Data Distribution (IDD) Global Observational Data

The IDD dataset contains ship and buoy records from the Global Telecommunication
System. It can be downloaded from [Research Data
Archive](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds336.0/). The relevant files are
the SYNOP and BUOY NetCDF files (2008-present), and the HISTSURFACEOBS tar
files (2003-2008). The HISTSURFACEOBS files have to be unpacked after
downloading.

In the examples below it is assumed that the IDD files are stored under
`data/idd/synop` and `data/idd/buoy` for the synop and buoy files,
respectively.

### Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)

CMIP5 and CMIP6 model output can be downloaded from the
[CMIP5](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/) and
[CMIP6](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) data archives.  The
relevant experiments are `historical` (`hist-1950` in the case of EC-Earth3P)
and `abrupt-4xCO2`. The required variables are `tas` in the monthly (`mon`)
frequency, and `rlut`, `rlutcs`, `rsdt`, `rsut`, `rsutcs` in the daily (`day`)
frequency.

The command `download_cmip` can be used to create a list of CMIP files
to download from a JSON catalog file, which can be created on the archive site
above (`return results as JSON` on the search page). `limit=` in the URL to the
JSON file should be changed to 10000, and `Show All Replicas` should be
selected when searching. The resulting file list can be used with the program
aria2c as `aria2c -i <file>` to download to files. Afterwards, use
the commands `create_by_model` and `create_by_var` to create an index of
symlinks in the directory where the downloaded files are stored. This index is
required by the main commands.

In the examples below it is assumed that the CMIP5 and CMIP6 files are stored
in `data/cmip5/<experiment>/<frequency/` and
`data/cmip6/<experiment>/<frequency/`, respectively.

### GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)

The GISTEMP dataset is in `data/gistemp` available as the original file
(CSV) and converted to NetCDF with `gistemp_to_nc` (required by the main
commands). The original dataset has been downloaded from [NASA
GISS](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), and the original terms of use of
this dataset apply.

## Main commands

terminal. The commands are located in the `bin` directory as should be run from
