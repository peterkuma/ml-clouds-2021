This repository contains code for the paper "Machine learning of cloud types
shows higher climate sensitivity is associated with lower cloud biases".

If you have any questions about the code you can contact the authors or submit
an Issue on GitHub.

## Requirements

The code can be run on a Linux distribution with the following software
(exact versions are listed for reproducibility, but newer version may work
equally well):

- Python 3.7.3
- Cython 0.29.2
- aria2 1.34.0

and Python packages:

- tensorflow 1.14.0
- scipy 1.7.0
- numpy 1.21.1
- matplotlib 3.5.1

- pst-format 1.1.1
- aquarius-time 0.1.1
- ds-format 1.2.0

- pandas 1.3.0

On Debian-based Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Devuan, ...), the required
software can be installed with:

```sh
apt install python3 cython3 aria2
```

We recommend installing the Python packages in a virtual environment (venv):

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

To install the Python packages:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Input datasets

### Historical Unidata Internet Data Distribution (IDD) Global Observational Data

The IDD dataset contains ship and buoy records from the Global Telecommunication
System. It can be downloaded from [Research Data
Archive](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds336.0/). The relevant files are
the SYNOP and BUOY NetCDF files (2008-present), and the HISTSURFACEOBS tar
files (2003-2008). The HISTSURFACEOBS files have to be unpacked after
downloading.

In the examples below it is assumed that the IDD files are stored under
`input/idd/synop` and `input/idd/buoy` for the synop and buoy files,
respectively.

### Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)

CMIP5 and CMIP6 model output can be downloaded from the
[CMIP5](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip5/) and
[CMIP6](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/) data archives.  The
relevant experiments are `historical` (`hist-1950` in the case of EC-Earth3P)
and `abrupt-4xCO2`. The required variables are `tas` in the monthly (`mon`)
frequency, and `rlut`, `rlutcs`, `rsdt`, `rsut`, `rsutcs` in the daily (`day`)
frequency.

The command `download_cmip` can be used to create a list of CMIP files
to download from a JSON catalog file, which can be created on the archive site
above (`return results as JSON` on the search page). `limit=` in the URL to the
JSON file should be changed to 10000, and `Show All Replicas` should be
selected when searching. The resulting file list can be used with the program
aria2c as `aria2c -i <file>` to download to files. Afterwards, use
the commands `create_by_model` and `create_by_var` to create an index of
symlinks in the directory where the downloaded files are stored. This index is
required by the main commands.

In the examples below it is assumed that the CMIP5 and CMIP6 files are stored
in `input/cmip5/<experiment>/<frequency/` and
`input/cmip6/<experiment>/<frequency/`, respectively, where `<experiment>`
is either `historical` (for both `historical` and `hist-1950`) or
`abrupt-4xCO2` and `<frequency>` is `day` or `mon`.

### GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)

The GISTEMP dataset is in `data/gistemp` available as the original file
(CSV) and converted to NetCDF with `gistemp_to_nc` (required by the main
commands). The original dataset has been downloaded from [NASA
GISS](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), and the original terms of use of
this dataset apply.

### CERES

SYN1deg Level 3 daily means can be downloaded from the [CERES website](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov).
They have to be converted to NetCDF with h4toh5 and stored in `input/ceres`.

### ERA5

ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels from 1979 to present can be downloaded
from the [Copernicus website](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/search?text=ERA5&type=dataset).
They have to be converted to daily mean files with cdo and stored in
`input/era5`.

### MERRA-2

The M2T1NXRAD MERRA-2 product can be downloaded from [NASA EarthData](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?project=MERRA-2).
Daily means can be downloaded with the GES DISC Subsetter. They have to
be stored in `input/merra-2`.

## Input directory

The input should contain the necessary input files. If not provided in this
repository, the files need to be downloaded from the CERES projet website,
the CMIP5 and CMIP6 archives, and RDA and placed in the respective directories.
